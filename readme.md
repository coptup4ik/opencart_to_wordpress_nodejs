This project was created to copy all data info from Opencart SQL to Wordpress SQL using Node js

1) Parse all data from website.
2) Load structured parsed data to MongoDB
3) Use this data to create wordpress posts. For this i'm replacing strings in wp_insert_post() and call this function on server side.
